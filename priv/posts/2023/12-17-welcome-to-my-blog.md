## Hello World!

Hi everyone, welcome! My name is Frank, and this is Frank Ferreira's blog. Here, I'll be writing about my career, things I'm learning, and critical thoughts on technology.

I'm using the Elixir language and the Phoenix framework for this application. Almost all modules are built with LiveView, and the blog itself is created with the Nimble Publisher library.

Please note that this website is still in development, so some things may not be fully adjusted yet.

Repositories:
- Elixir: [https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir)
- Phoenix: [https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix)
- Nimble: [https://github.com/dashbitco/nimble_publisher](https://github.com/dashbitco/nimble_publisher)


Happy coding!

-Frank Ferreira
